<section class="sec-2">
  <h4 > Nourishment is about more than the food you put in your mouth. There are many lifestyle factors that need to interact symbiotically to form a nourished, healthy individual: nutritious food, regular movement, job satisfaction, fulfilling relationships, spirituality, stress management, creativity, adequate sleep and regularly doing the things you love. The body is a powerful, integrative machine capable of self-healing when provided with these conditions.

                      With Kara’s help I have lost 20 pounds & dropped a size & a half. I exercise more & developed a better sleep schedule. I have more energy & feel that I can better handle my day to day stress. Kara’s approach is to have you look at all areas of your life to create balance and joy. Through all of this Kara has helped me to become happier, healthier & more confident.
