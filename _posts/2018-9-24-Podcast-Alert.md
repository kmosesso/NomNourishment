# Podcast Alert

Hey guys! A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to sit down with Sean Tierney, founder of Nomad Prep, and answer his questions about how to stay healthy on the road and the importance of choosing nourishing, whole, plant-based foods in general.  Scroll down for show notes. You can listen to my video podcast interview HERE.



Kara Mosesso is a nurse practitioner and certified health coach who has run 26 marathons and subsisted entirely on plants for the past decade. Hear her dietary advice for nomads.

Health and wellness on the road can be tricky when you don’t have the luxuries of your home kitchen. Today we’re chatting with Kara Mosesso of Nomadic Nourishment on the topic of how to maintain a healthy diet while on the road. Kate travelled with Remote Year Kublai for a year and now runs a nutrition and health coaching business on the side of her full-time job as a nurse practitioner.

In today’s conversation we delve into topics around maintaining a healthy diet abroad, resources for meal planning while on the road, the value of a primarily plant-based diet, sources for information on evidence-based nutrition, techniques for making lasting habit changes and more. Kara challenges listeners to take her 30-day plant-based challenge and shares a number of useful resources linked below for learning more about these subjects. Enjoy!
