title: Cognitive Conditioning
description: Welcome to the FINAL installment (6/6) in my brain health series! In my first post, I explained that lifestyle choices can prevent up to 90% of Alzheimer's cases.  For the 10% of cases that can't be prevented due to very strong genetic risk (such as in those that carry the APOE4 gene), lifestyle changes can delay presentation or progression of the disease by up to 15 years.

# Cognitive Conditioning

Almost all people in mid- and late life have at least some of the brain pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease, yet only a portion of people experience cognitive decline. Around age 40 there is a pivotal change in the health of the population. One group maintains health, one group actually improves and a third group starts a downward spiral. Obviously it’s important to live a healthy life, but the choices you make in your 40’s and 50’s are especially important. The expression of chronic disease in general (including Alzheimer's) is largely due to the way we live our lives. Engaging in activities that challenge the brain is an important way to maintain and **build cognitive** reserve. When most people think about exercises to challenge the brain, activities like crossword puzzles or Sudoku come to mind. While these certainly help to some extent, they are linear activities. It's far more beneficial to engage in complex activities. [Added bonus ](/2018/09/24/Podcast-Alert.html)for complex activities that cause some degree of unpleasantness or that include a component of meaningful social interaction.

> Social support and regular engagement with your community has an undeniable impact on the way your brain ages.

What kinds of activities are you regularly engaging in to optimize your brain health? While no one really wants to hear KARAoke, I regularly write articles, work in a complex profession and make it a point to learn new things. In November I am taking a coding bootcamp class, just cuz. I'm also of the opinion that travel is great for brain health. You are forced to navigate amidst new surroundings, you learn new things about people, places and culture, it can make you uncomfortable (#growthzone) and usually there is some element of meaningful social interaction.

I hope you've found the brain series helpful and learned something new. Go find some friends and get your cognitive conditioning on!
