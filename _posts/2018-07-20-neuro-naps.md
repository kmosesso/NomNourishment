description: Restorative sleep is crucial for cognitive and overall health. We often think of our bodies and brains as being inactive during sleep, but itâ€™s actually quite the opposite. Our brains are active in a very different kind of energetic state that promotes removal of toxins, oxidative by-products and amyloid.

<p>What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.
-Werner Herzog
Okay, I have to apologize because I've been sleeping on this blog.  I hate to make excuses, but I've been content and busy with a new job, fully immersing myself in SoCal living (I mean, I even bought a long board and a sun umbrella), marathon training and getting my Zzzzz's. Without further ado, welcome to installment 5/6 in my brain health series! This series is inspired by 'The Alzheimer's Solution' by Drs. Dean and Ayesha Sherazi. In my first post, I explained that lifestyle choices can prevent up to 90% of Alzheimer's cases.  For the 10% of cases that can't be prevented due to very strong genetic risk (such as in those that carry the APOE4 gene), lifestyle changes can delay presentation or progression of the disease by up to 15 years. There are 5 main lifestyle tenets for optimizing brain health that I am covering over the course of this blog series.  They include nutrition, exercise, stress management, sleep and regularly engaging in complex cognitive activities. The focus of this post is slumber and its impact on brain health. </p>
