    <h4> Nourishment is about more than the food you put in your mouth. There are many lifestyle factors that need to interact symbiotically to form a nourished, healthy individual: nutritious food, regular movement, job satisfaction, fulfilling relationships, spirituality, stress management, creativity, adequate sleep and regularly doing the things you love. The body is a powerful, integrative machine capable of self-healing when provided with these conditions.
